<h3>
Pre-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>In fluorescence, generally the state from which the system decays is independent of the excitation wavelength. Why?</li>
<li>What happen to the energy of the excited state and the emission spectrum when re-organization of solvent dipoles occurs around the excited fluorophore?</li>
<li>Compare the effects of increase in refractive index and dielectric constant on the ground and excited state energies.</li>
<li>The Lippert-Mataga equation tends to give greater than the predicted Stokes shifts for protic solvents like water and alcohols. Why?</li>
<li>When the solvent has no permanent dipole moment, how n is related to ε and what is the value of Δf?</li>
</ol>
<h3>
Post-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>How many grams of curcumin should one dissolve in a given solvent to prepare a 100 mL 1x10-3M stock solution?</li>
<li>In Lippert-Mataga plots, groups of solvents with similar chemical nature often tend to cluster. Why?</li>
<li>If one obtains a positive slope in the Lippert-Mataga plot, is the excited state more polar or less polar than the ground state?</li>
<li>In the Lippert-Mataga plot, does the point corresponding to methanol lie above or below the straight line fit? What could be the possible reason for this?</li>
<li>What do the steady state spectral measurements of curcumin suggest about the polarity of the S1 state with respect to its S0 ground state?</li>
