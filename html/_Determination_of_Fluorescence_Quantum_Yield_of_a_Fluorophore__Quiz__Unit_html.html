<h3>
Pre-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
If the intensities of the sample and reference beam are both the same, what is the value of absorbance?
</li>
<li>
What is the % transmission for an absorbance of 1?
</li>
<li>
What is the unit of the absorbance?
</li>
<li>
'HOMO-LUMO electronic transitions are properties of the groups of atoms.' Is the statement true or false?
</li>
<li>
What kinds of electronic transitions are observed in carbonyl compounds?
</li>
<li>
How are the absorbance and transmittance related at the spectral peak position?
</li>
</ol>
<h3>
Post-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
What kind of cuvettes (glass or quartz) will you use for a wavelength scan spanning the UV-visible range?
</li>
<li>
What do you expect if you run the wavelength scan by mistakenly placing the sample in the reference 
holder and the sample blank or reference in the sample holder? 
</li>
<li>
It is necessary not to touch the cuvette on sides that come across the light path and wipe out gently all the sides with lint free paper. Why? 
</li>
<li>
What does an absorption spectrum of a sample tell about the colour of the sample?
</li>
<li>
Though caffeine absorbs light, yet it is colourless. Why?
</li>
<li>
How do the samples look like in following two cases: when absorbance values of the samples are (i) close to zero and (ii) very high in the entire visible range?
</li>
<li>
Which compound of the two studied here absorbs light of higher energy per photon?
</li>
<li>
Which colors of light do caffeine and potassium dichromate absorb?
</li>
</ol>
