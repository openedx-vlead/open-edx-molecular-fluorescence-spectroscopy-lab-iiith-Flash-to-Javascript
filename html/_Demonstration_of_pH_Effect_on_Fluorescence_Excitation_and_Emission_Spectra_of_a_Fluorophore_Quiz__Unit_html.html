Pre-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>What are the advantages of using fluorescein molecule for pH-dependent fluorescence studies?</li>
<li>What kind of electronic transition is responsible for fluorescence in fluorescein molecule?</li>
<li>Which proton is lost last from the fluorescein molecule when fluorescein reacts with NaOH?</li>
<li>Methanolic solution of fluorescein is acidic, pH= 4. How can you explain this?</li>
</ol>
<h3>
Post-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Out of two carboxylic acid forms, which form of fluorescein molecule fluoresces most intensely?</li>
<li>Which molecular form of fluorescein molecule requires more energy for electronic transition?</li>
<li>Why did the shoulder peaks appear in the excitation and emission spectra when NaOH was not added?</li>
<li>How do the Stokes shifts vary depending on the pH of the solution?</li>
