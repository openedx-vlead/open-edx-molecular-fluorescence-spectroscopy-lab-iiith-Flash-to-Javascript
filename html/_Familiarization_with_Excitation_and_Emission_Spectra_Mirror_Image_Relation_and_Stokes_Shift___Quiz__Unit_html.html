Pre-Experiment Quiz
</h3>
<ol>
<li>What are the spin multiplicity and the spin of triplet state?</li>
<li>Why two electrons are always present in two different orbitals of the molecule in triplet state?</li>
<li>Internal conversion (takes place at a time scale of 10-12 s) is faster than the fluorescence emission. Then how does radiative emission (fluorescence) compete with the non-radiative transition? (Hint: Significantly larger energy gap between S1 and S0 and longer lifetime of S1.)</li>
<li>Transitions between states of different multiplicity are formally forbidden. What are the mechanisms that make the intersystem crossing probable?</li>
<li>How can you justify that the relaxation to ground state occurs via “vertical” transition?</li>
<li>In most of the cases, the S1 potential energy curve shifts to the right with respect to S0 potential energy curve. Justify it. (Hint: In the excited state, the electron is promoted to an anti-bonding orbital.)</li>
</ol>

Post-Experiment Quiz
</h3>
<ol>
<li>What happens in Stokes shift: The fluorescence light is red-shifted (shifts to longer wavelength than the excitation light) or blue-shifted relative to the absorbed light?</li>
<li>How does the solvent effect affect the magnitude of the Stokes shift?</li>
<li>Why is the same fluorescence emission wavelength observed irrespective of the excitation wavelength?</li>
<li>Vibrational levels of which of the electronic states – electronic ground state or electronically excited state – are reflected by an emission spectrum?</li>
<li>“The detection of a fluorescent molecule becomes easier when the Stokes shift is larger. ” Why?</li>
<li>Do both the fluorophores obey the mirror image rule and why?</li>
<li>Which of the two fluorophores has larger area of overlapping region between the absorption and emission spectra? (Note:
The overlapping region relates to the auto-absorption in inner filter effects.)</li>
