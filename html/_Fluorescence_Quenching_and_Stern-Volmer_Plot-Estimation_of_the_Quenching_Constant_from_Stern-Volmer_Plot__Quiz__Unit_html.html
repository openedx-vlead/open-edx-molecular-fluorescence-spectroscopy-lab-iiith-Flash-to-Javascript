<h3>Pre-experiment Quiz</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Why is dynamic quenching mechanism not operative in rigid systems?
</li><li>
“Fluorescence of compounds of long lifetime, such as naphthalene and pyrene, are particularly sensitive to the presence of oxygen.” Why?
</li><li>
Mention one method by which oxygen quenching can be avoided. 
</li><li>
Will the mean fluorescence life time measured in the presence of dynamic quenching be different from that measured in the absence of the quenching? Why?
</li><li>
How will the fluorescence life time be affected in static quenching?
</li><li>
“Dynamic quenching increases with temperature.” Why?

<h3>Pre-experiment Quiz</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Why is  anthracene faint yellow in color?
</li><li>
How many gram of anthracene is required to make a 2.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> M anthracene solution in 100 mL ethanol? 
</li><li>
Neglecting the volume of pyridinium chloride added with respect to the volume of anthracene solution, calculate the total concentrations of pyridinium chloride in the solution after each addition. 
</li><li>
Calculate the % increase in volume due to the additions of the quenching solution to the original solution. Discuss how this dilution effect will affect the concentrations of the quencher. 
</li><li>
What is unit of K<sub>SV</sub>?
</li><li>
How is the quantity, (F<sub>0</sub>/F - 1) / [Q], independent of quencher concentration for dynamic quenching?
</li><li>
How is K<sub>SV</sub> related to the quenching concentration at 50% quenching?
</li><li>
What does it suggest when k<sub>q</sub> and the diffusion controlled rate constant, k<sub>d</sub>, have similar values?
</li>
