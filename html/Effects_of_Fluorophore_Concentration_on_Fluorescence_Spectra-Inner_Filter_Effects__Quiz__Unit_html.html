<h3>
Pre-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Mention three different ways by which the fluorophore concentration can affect the fluorescence spectral characteristics.
</li>
<li>
Mention two ways by which one can avoid inner filter effects.
</li>
<li>
Explain how fluorophores with large Stokes shifts are less sensitive to the inner filter effects.
</li>
<li>
Mention the geometrical as well as the mathematical reason for which the fluorescence intensity of a fluorophore is proportional to the concentration over only a limited range of absorbances. (Hint: Mathematical: I<sub>F</sub> = kΦ<sub>F</sub> I<sub>0</sub> (1  e<sup>-2.3εcl</sup> ) and (1- e<sup>2.3A</sup>) = 2.3 A, when A &lt;&lt; 1)
</li>
<li>
	What kinds of illumination geometries are useful for fluorescence studies of optically dense samples or highly scattering solutions?
</li>
<li>
	What kind of illumination geometry should one use to minimize the excitation inner filter effect?
</li>
</ol>
<h3>
Post-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Why should one start the measurement with the lowest concentration first and go on to the next higher concentration while doing the measurement?
</li>
<li>

Why should one always rinse the cuvette with the experimental solution prior to filling up of the cuvette with the experimental solution?
</li>
<li>
What kind of illumination geometry was used in this experiment?
</li>
<li>
Why does the shorter wavelength part of anthracene fluorescence get attenuated unlike its long wavelength part?
</li>
<li>
Why does the fluorescence attenuation increase with the increasing anthracene concentration?
</li>
