<li>
	How does fluorescence intensity depend on the excitation power? Can the fluorescence sensitivity be increased by working with high excitation powers?
	</li><li>
	What should be the fluorescence intensity for sample blank (analyte concentration is 0)?
	</li><li>
	Excitation with a laser will yield a better fluorescence intensity than if a lamp were used for excitation . Why?
	</li><li>
	The product Î¦F I<sub>0</sub> determines the sensitivity of fluorimetry for the analyte. Justify your answer.
	</li><li>
	Consider a case where a fluorophore molecule gets excited more than once. How will this effect (called the photon-burst effect) affect your result?
	</li><li>
	Why is it advised that  add acid to water  while diluting concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>?
	</li><li>
Explain how a mass of 0.120 g of quinine sulfate is needed to prepare a quinine stock solution of 100  g/mL concentration. (Given (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>24</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O), MW= 782.97)

<h3>
	Post-Experiment
	</h3>
<ol>
<li>
	In real experimental measurements, one should start with the lowest concentration solution first and proceed to next higher concentration and so on and should rinse the cuvette every time by taking a small portion of the experimental solution prior to filling up the cuvette with the solution. Why?
	</li><li>
	Is there evidence of non-linearity in the relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the analyte concentration at high concentrations? What is the most likely source of the non-linearity?
	</li><li>
	Will the linearity relationship hold well if photodecomposition of the molecule takes place on excitation?
	</li><li>
	How can one verify whether concentration quenching is present or not?
	</li><li>
	Why is the fluorescence intensity usually plotted in arbitrary units unlike absorbance in absorption spectrum? What is the unit of absorbance? 
	</li><li>
	How many ppb (parts per billion) is 0.0250 ppm (parts per million)?
	</li><li>
	Express 0.01 ppm quinine concentration in mol/L unit.  
	</li>
