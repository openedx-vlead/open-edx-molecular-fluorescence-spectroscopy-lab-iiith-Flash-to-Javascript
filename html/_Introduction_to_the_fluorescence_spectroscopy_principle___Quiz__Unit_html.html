<li>How many possible orientations can two parallel spins adopt with respect to the external magnetic field? Show by schematic diagram.</li>
<li>What are the spin multiplicity and the spin of triplet state?</li>
<li>Why two electrons are always present in two different orbitals of the molecule in triplet state?</li>
<li>Internal conversion (takes place at a time scale of 10-12 s) is faster than the fluorescence emission. Then how does radiative emission (fluorescence) compete with the non-radiative transition? (Hint: Significantly larger energy gap between S1 and S0 and longer lifetime of S1.)</li>
<li>Transitions between states of different multiplicity are formally forbidden. What are the mechanisms that make the intersystem crossing probable?</li>
<li>How can you justify that the relaxation to ground state occurs via “vertical” transition?</li>
<li>In most of the cases, the S1 potential energy curve shifts to the right with respect to S0 potential energy curve. Justify it. (Hint: In the excited state, the electron is promoted to an anti-bonding orbital.)</li>
<li>Why are absorption and fluorescence much faster than phosphorescence?</li>
